Files in this directory are instances generated by the oXygen XML instance generation tool.

The name of the schema used to generate the files (Schema 1) is given by a comment.
The schema(s) associated with the instances (Schema 2, ...) may be different than the schema used to generate the file.

The purpose of these auto-generated instances files is to test compatibility between two related schemas.
An associated schema (Schema 2, ...) is intended to be a generalization of the schema (Schema 1) used to generate the instance.
Verification of this relationship depends on all instances of Schema 1 being valid under Schema 2.

Note: post-processing may be necessary to obtain an instance which validates against the genrating schema. In particular, there may be empty arg elements
