# Managing the ordered and unordered forms of the extended Node header pattern in DR
# 1. to deal with the different distribution of oid, define a new pattern for element oid that
# is added to Node.header if the oid_all module is included. 
# This is a temporary fix until the oid distribution is harmonized in the next release.
# 2. to deal with the different definition of the meta element, define a new patterm for
# element meta that is added to Node.header if the meta_indexed module is included.
# This is a temporary fix until the meta distribution is harmonized in the next release.
