  <!--
     *** scope ***
     
     metadata-based scope definition defined over the metadata annotations and the qualifications annotations.
     
     see: http://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php/Glossary_of_Reaction_RuleML_1.02#gloss-scope
     
     Note: scope reasoning in rules can use the metadata scopes to define a constructive view on the rules and facts in the KB.    
     The scoped rule/literal goal only applies in this scope (scoped reasoning/processing)
     
     For an implementation of scoped reasoning as a mechanism to dynamicaly create a scope (a constructive view)
     on the knowledge base and to do scoped reasoning on this scope see the Prova rule engine (http://prova.ws).
     
     Example:
     @src(kb1) @author("Adrian Paschke") @validity([2015-03-20, 2015-04-20]) @label(fact1) fact1(constant1).
     @src(kb2) @author("Alex Kozlenkov") @validity([2015-01-20, 2015-03-20]) @label(fact2) fact2(constant2).
     
     @src(rb1) @label(rule1) rule1(Y) :- @validity(VTime) @authors("Adrian Paschke") fact1(Y) [between(SysTime,VTime)] 
     
     In this example all knowledge is annotated with predefined (@src, ...) and user-defined metadata annotations (@author, @validity, ...). 
     User-defined metadata annotations can be arbitrary name/value pairs described as predicates. The literal "fact1" in the body
     of "rule1" is a scoped literal defining a scope over knowledge in the knowledge base with the scope constraints
     @validity and @author. If such knowledge is found in the KB the meta data value (an Interval) for @validity
     is bound to the variable "VTime" and used in the guard constraint [...] on the literal. The guard is stating that 
     the actual system time should be  within the validity interval. The second scope constraint is directly compared 
     to the constant value "Adrian Paschke".
     The sub-goal literal "fact1" in the rule condition is then applied only on the selected scope 
     (a constructive view on the overall knowledge base which is selected by the metadata scope of the literal) and not on the 
     overal knowledge. It is possible to define scopes for modules (e.g. sets of knowledge such as a rule-base/rule-set or 
     an knowledge updates (assert, retracts) by using the meta data identifier such as @src or @label. Such identifiers can
     be also used for transactional logics.
     
     In Reaction RuleML general metadata annotations (descriptive metadata) are defined under the <meta> tag role and
     qualifying metadata which qualify the rule (such as validity in the above example) are defined under the <qualification> tag.
     The @key attribute which defines a unique identifier for knowledge in the knowledge base is used for a 
     modular nested structuring of the knowledge base. The @key of e.g. <Assert key=""> or <Rulebase key=""> acts as module identifier 
     (which in Prova is denoted by the predefined @src metadata).
     
	 Scopes in Reaction RuleML can be defined within the <scope> role tag on descriptive metadata <meta> and qualifying metadata <qualification> as well as
	 on the unique identifier @key of the knowledge in the knowledge base (<Assert key="">, <Rulebase key="">, <Rule key="">, <Atom key="">)
	 by referencing it with the @keyref attribute.
	 
	 There is a nesting of scopes. Scopes defined on the more general level automatically apply to the body knowledge. For instance, a scope
	 defined on the level of a <Rulebase> automatically applies to all goal literals of the <Rule>s in the rulebase. body scopes
	 overwrite the head scope. For instance a scope defined on <Assert> becomes overwritten by an body scope defined on a <Rule> which is within the
	 this asserted knowledge module. That is the goal literals within this rules are automatically applying the innter scope and not the head scope.
	 
	 Note: the old approach which used <oid> to define a scope has been replaces by the key-keyref approach in Reaction RuleML 1.0
     
     Note: multiple scopes can be defined by repeating the <scope> role element
     Note: an empty scope either assumes the head scope or an existing scope needs to be explicity referenced by keyref

     *** signature ***
     
     The signature defines the signature of knowledge (formula and terms) with optional input / output mode declarations. The signature declaration can act as public interface and

	see: http://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php/Glossary_of_Reaction_RuleML_1.02#gloss-signature
	
	Note: In PR, RR and CEP reaction rules the signature is extended with events and actions
	for defining the event templates (i.e. the event form / event descriptor which corresponds to the event type/class. The event template is used for
	pattern machting, i.e. in the on part of a reaction rule it triggers the reaction rule if the template matches with required event instances, which are
	instantiations of the event type / class to which make up the required properties of the event template.
		
	Multiple signatures are possible by repreating the <signature> element

    Note: the qualification can be also defined as a situation  <Situation> in KR Reaction RuleML 
	A situation could be also modelled as a changeable situation called fluent (in the KR dialect of Reaction RuleML),
	which changes its truth value depending on the context (context can be time, events/actions which 
	initiate/terminate the changeable situation, or a history of occured events/actions which leads to an occured situation
	as context for the truth changes of the fluent.
	
	That would mean the qualification of the rule changes depending on the situation (the truth value of the fluent in KR RuleML)
